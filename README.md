# My AutoHotkey Scripts
[![ahk version](https://img.shields.io/badge/AHK-2.0--beta.1-428B42)]()

A collection of my AutoHotkey v2 scripts which I use on the daily.

In my startup folder I have a shortcut to `__main.ahk2`, which when run includes all scripts in the `Scripts/` folder. All scripts are short, self-contained, and consice (hopefully).
