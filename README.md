# My AutoHotKey Scripts
[![ahk version](https://img.shields.io/badge/ahk-2.0-brightgreen)]()

A collection of my AutoHotKey v2 scripts which I use on the daily.

In my startup folder I have a shortcut to `__main.ahk`, which when run includes all scripts in the `Scripts/` folder. All scripts are short and consice.
