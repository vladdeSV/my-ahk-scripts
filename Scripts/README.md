# Summary
Breif explanation of what each script does. Might not always be up do date with all scripts.

I orignially had this setup on my mac, but I got so used to it so I had to have it on my PC as well.
## [Application Opener.ahk](/Scripts/Application%20Opener.ahk)
Opens/shows application on input.

Specific to my keyboard setup (Corsair K95 (old model with 18 macro keys)). I've bound keyboard shortcuts to this.

## [EasyWindowDrag.ahk](/Scripts/EasyWindowDrag.ahk)
Rewritten script which allows me to move and resize a window by only holding the cursor over the window and holding my Mouse4 or Mouse5.

## [Hotstrings.ahk](/Scripts/Hotstrings.ahk)
Simple abbr.

## [Mute Microphone.ahk](/Scripts/Mute%20Microphone.ahk)
Loops specific applications and sends application-specific hotkeys to mute the microphone, eg. *Discord* and *Microsoft Teams*.
