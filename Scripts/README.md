# Summary
Breif explanation of what each script does. Might not always be up do date with all scripts.

## [Alternative Keybinds.ahk2](/Scripts/Alternative%20Keybinds.ahk2)
- Changes the <kbd>Caps-Lock</kbd> key to <kbd>Delete</kbd>. Still possible to activate by holding down a modifier key, like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
- Mimics some macOS keybinds (`{`, `}`, and `@`)

I orignially had this setup on my mac, but I got so used to it so I had to have it on my PC as well.
## [Application Opener.ahk2](/Scripts/Application%20Opener.ahk2)
Opens/shows application on input.

Specific to my keyboard setup. I've bound my 6 macro keys to this.

## [EasyWindowDrag.ahk2](/Scripts/EasyWindowDrag.ahk2)
Rewritten script which allows me to move and resize a window by only holding the cursor over the window and holding my Mouse4 or Mouse5.

## [Hotstrings.ahk2](/Scripts/Hotstrings.ahk2)
Simple abbr.
