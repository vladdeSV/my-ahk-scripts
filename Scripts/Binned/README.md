Scripts I no longer use.

## [Quick Task View.ahk2](/Scripts/Quick%20Task%20View.ahk2)
Allows me to open Task View in a different way.

## [Virtual Desktop Switcher.ahk2](/Scripts/Virtual%20Desktop%20Switcher.ahk2)
Quickly move between virtual virtual desktops.

## [Toggle Maximized.ahk2](/Scripts/Toggle%20Maximized.ahk2)
Allows me to instantly maximize or unmaximize a window. Replaced by addition of partially same feature in [EasyWindowDrag.ahk2](https://github.com/vladdeSV/my-ahk-scripts/blob/271cc51339c31aa507234556c0ca0cb27013b7dd/Scripts/EasyWindowDrag.ahk2#L56-L60).
