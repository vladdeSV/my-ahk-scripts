Scripts I no longer use.

## [Quick Task View.ahk](/Scripts/Quick%20Task%20View.ahk)
Allows me to open Task View in a different way.

## [Virtual Desktop Switcher.ahk](/Scripts/Virtual%20Desktop%20Switcher.ahk)
Quickly move between virtual virtual desktops.

## [Toggle Maximized.ahk](/Scripts/Toggle%20Maximized.ahk)
Allows me to instantly maximize or unmaximize a window. Replaced by addition of partially same feature in [EasyWindowDrag.ahk](https://github.com/vladdeSV/my-ahk-scripts/blob/271cc51339c31aa507234556c0ca0cb27013b7dd/Scripts/EasyWindowDrag.ahk#L56-L60).

## [Alternative Keybinds.ahk](/Scripts/Alternative%20Keybinds.ahk)
- Changes the <kbd>Caps-Lock</kbd> key to <kbd>Delete</kbd>. Still possible to activate by holding down a modifier key, like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
- Mimics some macOS keybinds (`{`, `}`, and `@`)
